Counterbalance 10:00PM
the idea is to go to the next checkpoint, but subtract your current velocity - so you aim at a different spot

FINALLY FIXED MY PASCAL BUG!
Counterbalance 10:01PM
and the value that works best is to subtract 3* your velocity.
^ subtract the vector, not the abs value ;)


-3vel
In the game page there's a few links, one of them is on PID controllers and steering



well, a tiny part is missing regarding thrust
 the size of vector between where you are and the point you're aiming at, also tells you how fast to go
 if it's larger than the distance you can travel in one turn, use the max thrust of 100; if the distance is < 100, use less thrust; you'll end up with zero velocity exactly at that point you're aiming at.
 (if you tweak the numbers and take current velocity into account etc..)
 Do you calculalte your velocity? It's  current_pos - prev_pos

 that's what basically got me to gold
 
 
 
 
 what should happen if (checkpoint.dist(pod.position - 3*pod.velocity) < checkpointRadius) ?
 - Epsiom you start aiming for the checkpoint after that - or if you don't know, the center of the map
 - Epsiom point towards next checkpoint (or if you don;t know what it is, thrust =0)
 
 
 Epsiom use a minimum thrust of 10 or so, it should help, and remove that turnsSinceLastCheckpoint - it might only trigger at the end of the last lap in most games..
 
 IMPORTANT:
 btw you only pass a checkpoint if the center of the pod is inside the checkpoint, so the pod radius doesn't matter here
 
 
 Epsiom 10:36PM
 Okay so the check with the velocity from earlier
 (checkpoint.dist(pod.position - 3*pod.velocity) < checkpointRadius)
 It's just to guarantee that from now on, even if I turn, I should be passing the checkpoint?
Counterbalance 10:39PM
what it does is see if you are within the checkpoint on the next turn
Epsiom 10:40PM
where does my outpust thrust is into this?
 Does it work regardless of it?
 Counterbalance 10:42PM
in most cases, yes, even at max thrust, but, you could end up spinning around a checkpoint
it's better to modulate thrust based on your angle
Epsiom 10:43PM
what?
 in what way?
Counterbalance 10:43PM
if you're facing more than 90 deg away from the checkpoint, it's better not to thrust, or you'll move away from the checkpoint, instead of closer
 that's the basic idea
